# 👋 Hi, I'm Riddhi

I'm a developer and researcher with experience in **data science**, **applied machine learning**, and a strong interest in **software development**. I enjoy working on projects that combine theoretical depth with real-world impact.

## 💼 Experience & Projects
- 🧠 Worked on **agentic AI** and enhanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques to improve reasoning and factual accuracy in generative systems.
- ⚙️ Built an **automated forecasting pipeline** to predict business metrics at scale, enabling data-driven decisions through end-to-end integration and modeling.
- 🤖 Developed a reinforcement learning framework enabling autonomous agents to self-regulate by modeling internal states with optimal control theory and neural function approximation.
- 🧮 Created a **mathematical computation tool** to support researchers working with non-standard algebraic structures, enabling more efficient experimentation and hypothesis testing.
- 💰 Developed a **personal finance app** to help users track expenses, analyze spending habits, and gain insights into budgeting.
- 🎬 Built a **movie recommendation system** using collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized suggestions based on user preferences and viewing history.

## 🧠 Interests & Learning Goals
I'm exploring how language models can be engineered to act as reliable, modular components in software systems.
